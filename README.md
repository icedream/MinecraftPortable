# Minecraft Portable
by Icedream

This launcher allows you to make (your) Minecraft portable!

## Features
- Always up-to-date: The launcher is watching for updates at startup and downloads them if they are available (only works without "ZIP extraction").
- ZIP extraction: You can pack your .minecraft in zip file ("minecraft.zip") and put it in the same folder with the launcher so that you can use your own Minecraft from anywhere.
- Two login ways: You may use your Minecraft paid account to access online servers, but you may also use the launcher to play Minecraft via LAN or offline servers.
- Multiple JARs support: You can choose the JAR to use in the login window.
